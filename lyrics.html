<b>Chicken on the beat, let the flavor unfold,
Golden in the fryer, crispy, bold.
From the farm to the table, everybody know,
When the chicken hit the plate, that’s the star of the show.


Step in the kitchen, yeah, I’m feelin’ that heat,
Wings in the basket, that’s my kind of treat.
Spicy or mild, I don’t care the style,
Put the sauce on top, make it drip for a while.


Chicken on the beat, let the flavor unfold,
Golden in the fryer, crispy, bold.
From the farm to the table, everybody know,
When the chicken hit the plate, that’s the star of the show.


Drumstick king with the cluck-cluck sound,
Bucket in my hand, pass the joy around.
Nuggets in the box with the fries on deck,
Barbecue dreams and respect on check.


Grilled in the summer, roasted in the fall,
Chicken got the love, it’s the favorite of all.
Rap it, trap it, snack it, don’t quit,
Every single bite is a certified hit.
